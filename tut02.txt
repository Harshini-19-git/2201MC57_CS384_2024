You cant use any inbuilt functions of Python 

Learn if and for loop yourself. 

1. Unitary Sum of Digits
Write a program that takes an integer as input and calculates the sum of its digits using a loop. The program should repeatedly sum the digits until a single digit is obtained. Do not use Python’s built-in functions for string manipulation. 

Here’s an example to illustrate how the program works:

Input:
- Suppose the user inputs the number '942'.

Step-by-Step Execution:

1. First Iteration:
   - Initial 'n': 942
   - Sum of digits:
     - 9 + 4 + 2 = 15
   - Update 'n': 15 (since 942 is not a single digit)

2. Second Iteration:
   - New 'n': 15
   - Sum of digits:
     - 1 + 5 = 6
   - Update 'n': 6 (since 15 is not a single digit)

3. Result:
   - Now 'n' is 6, which is a single digit.
   - The digital root of '942' is 6.

### Output: 
Enter an integer: 942
The Unitary Sum of Digits of 942 is: 6 


2. String Compression
Implement a basic string compression algorithm where consecutive identical characters in a string are replaced by the character followed by the count of repetitions. For example, the input "aaabbc" should be compressed to "a3b2c1". Do not use Python’s built-in functions for string manipulation.
